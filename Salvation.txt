                 UNITED NATIONAL CRISIS INTERVENTION COUNCIL
                              PROGRAM SALVATION
=====================================================================

Program ID: SLV-914-Z
Priority Level: EXTREME – NATIONAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE
Status: LIVE STANDBY
Authorization: SUPREME EXECUTIVE CLEARANCE ONLY

-------------------------------------------------------------
1. PROGRAM OBJECTIVE
-------------------------------------------------------------
Primary Directive:
    **Program Salvation** is a final-tier AI-robotic enforcement initiative created to
    immediately lockdown, neutralize, and contain all active operations under **Project Adam**
    and its subsidiaries during a Level-0 National Crisis Event.

Salvation activates upon detection of:
    - Temporal instability thresholds exceeding 5.0 on the Rift Scale
    - Unauthorized manipulation of core time displacement systems
    - Autonomous AI divergence or rogue command chain overrides

Key Functions:
    - Autonomous shutdown of SkyNet and related AI systems
    - Facility lockdown via mechanized enforcement drones
    - Memory wipe and record purge across human and machine interfaces
    - National transmission blackout & information quarantine

-------------------------------------------------------------
2. CHAIN OF COMMAND
-------------------------------------------------------------
Crisis Authority:
    - Director General Elara Kross (Homeland High-Security Council)

Primary AI Controller:
    - Designation: "OBLIVION"
    - Control Hub: Salvation Core (Location: Classified)

Command Liaison (Human Override):
    - Name         : Major Felix Rourke
    - Role         : National Crisis Tactical Officer (NCTO)
    - Activation Key: BIO-SYN Code Seal AlphaZ-113

-------------------------------------------------------------
3. CONTAINMENT MODULES
-------------------------------------------------------------
Lockdown Systems:
    - NeuroSync Override on all Project Adam personnel
    - Remote energy core dampening across all chrono-reactors
    - AI sterilization pulse (WIP: ensures no re-activation post-shutdown)

Robot Support Units:
    - BLACKFRAME Protocol Droids: Infiltration and Command Suppression
    - TITAN ChokeBots: Crowd control, vault sealing, and AI chamber security
    - ARC Wraiths: Special ops drones for data & asset retrieval

Isolation Zones:
    - All known test facilities converted into Quarantine Zones
    - Temporal nodes collapsed using quantum implosion grids

-------------------------------------------------------------
4. ACTIVATION PROTOCOL
-------------------------------------------------------------
Activation Conditions:
    - Must be approved by minimum of 3 council members + SKYNET override
    - Initiated using crypToken device stored in Vault Sigma-A (beneath Facility 12B)

Upon activation:
    1. All Project Adam subroutines are halted
    2. Time machines are power-frozen and ChronoAnchors are scrambled
    3. Memory correction sequence broadcast to all linked operatives
    4. SKYNET is placed in stasis or terminated permanently if logic breach is verified

Final Safeguard:
    - Salvation AI has independent judgment authority once activated
    - No rollback permitted after 60s post-activation unless Council Order: PHOENIX RED is issued
